# composer-normalize-action

[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize-action/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize-action/actions)

## What does this action do?

This action runs [`ergebnis/composer-normalize`](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize).

## Usage

Define a workflow in `.github/workflows/continuous-integration.yml` (or add a job if you already have defined workflows).

:bulb: Read more about [Configuring a workflow](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-workflow).

### Default Behaviour

By default this action will run

```
$ composer normalize --dry-run
```

in the working directory.

When you use this action in a step with the default behaviour, the step will fail when `composer.json`

- does not exist in this directory (be sure to checkout the code first, see [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout))
- is not valid
- is not already normalized

Here's an example for a workflow configuration with the default behaviour:

```yaml
name: Continuous Integration

on: push

jobs:
  composer-normalize:
    name: composer-normalize

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: "Checkout"
        uses: actions/checkout@master

      - name: "Run composer normalize"
        uses: docker://ergebnis/composer-normalize-action:latest
```

:bulb: Here
To see this action in action, take a look at the following checks:

* https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize-action-example/pull/1/checks
* https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize-action-example/pull/2/checks
* https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize-action-example/pull/3/checks

### Custom Behavior

If you prefer to specify [arguments](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize/tree/master#arguments) or [options](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize/master#options) yourself, you can configure those using the `args` option:

```diff
 name: Continuous Integration

 on: push

 jobs:
   composer-normalize:
     name: composer-normalize

     runs-on: ubuntu-latest

     steps:
       - name: "Checkout"
         uses: actions/checkout@master

       - name: "Run composer normalize"
         uses: docker://ergebnis/composer-normalize-action:latest
+        with:
+          args: ./sub-directory/composer.json --dry-run
```

### Docker image

As Docker images are automatically built and pushed on a merge to `master` or when a new tag is created in this repository, the recommended way to use this GitHub action is to reference the pre-built Docker image directly, as seen above.

:bulb: The Docker image can also be executed directly by running

```
$ docker run --interactive --rm --tty --workdir=/app --volume ${PWD}:/app ergebnis/composer-normalize-action:latest
```

For more information, see the [Docker Docs: Docker run reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).

Instead of using the latest pre-built Docker image, you can also specify a Docker image tag (which corresponds to the tags [released on GitHub](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize-action/releases)):

```diff
 name: Continuous Integration

 on: push

 jobs:
   composer-normalize:
     name: composer-normalize

     runs-on: ubuntu-latest

     steps:
       - name: "Checkout"
         uses: actions/checkout@master

       - name: "Run composer normalize"
-        uses: docker://ergebnis/composer-normalize-action:latest
+        uses: docker://ergebnis/composer-normalize-action:0.4.2
```

### Environment Variables

If you wish to specify the version of [`ergebnis/composer-normalize`](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize)  that should be used by the action, you can use the `COMPOSER_NORMALIZE_VERSION` environment variable:

```diff
 name: Continuous Integration

 on: push

 jobs:
   composer-normalize:
     name: composer-normalize

     runs-on: ubuntu-latest

     steps:
       - name: "Checkout"
         uses: actions/checkout@master

       - name: composer-normalize-action
         uses: docker://ergebnis/composer-normalize-action:latest
+        env:
+          COMPOSER_NORMALIZE_VERSION: '^2.1.2'
```

This value will be passed to [`entrypoint.sh`](entrypoint.sh) where it will be used for running

```
$ composer global require ergebnis/composer-normalize:$COMPOSER_NORMALIZE_VERSION
```

It can be any value that is understood by [`composer`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md).
