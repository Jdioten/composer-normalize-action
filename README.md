# composer-normalize-action

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/localheinz/composer-normalize-action.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/localheinz/composer-normalize-action)

## What does this action do?

This action runs [`localheinz/composer-normalize`](https://github.com/localheinz/composer-normalize) with the `--dry-run` option.

That is, when you enable this action, the action will fail when a `composer.json` is pushed that is not valid or not already normalized.

## Usage

Define a workflow in `.github/main.workflow` like this:

```
workflow "Main" {
  on = "push"
  resolves = ["composer-normalize"]
}

action "composer-normalize" {
  uses = "docker://localheinz/composer-normalize-action"
}
```

You can also use a specific tag, for example, `0.2.4` (otherwise, `latest` will be used).

```
workflow "Main" {
  on = "push"
  resolves = ["composer-normalize"]
}

action "composer-normalize" {
  uses = "docker://localheinz/composer-normalize-action:0.2.4"
}
```

### Docker
