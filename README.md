# composer-normalize-action

[![CI Status](https://github.com/localheinz/composer-normalize-action/workflows/Continuous%20Integration/badge.svg)](https://github.com/localheinz/composer-normalize-action/actions)
[![CD Status](https://github.com/localheinz/composer-normalize-action/workflows/Continuous%20Deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/localheinz/composer-normalize-action/actions)

## What does this action do?

This action runs [`localheinz/composer-normalize`](https://github.com/localheinz/composer-normalize) with the `--dry-run` option.

That is, when you enable this action, the action will fail when a `composer.json` is pushed that is not valid or not already normalized.

## Usage

Define a workflow in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (or add a job if you already have defined workflows). Here's a basic example:

```yaml
name: CI

on: push

jobs:
  composer-normalize:
    name: composer-normalize
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: composer-normalize-action
        uses: docker://localheinz/composer-normalize-action:latest
```

### Docker image

As Docker images are automatically built and pushed on a merge to `master` or when a new tag is created in this repository, the recommended way to use this GitHub action is to reference the pre-built Docker image directly, as seen above.

:bulb: The Docker image can also be executed directly by running

```
$ docker run --interactive --rm --tty --workdir=/app --volume ${PWD}:/app localheinz/composer-normalize-action:latest
```

For more information, see the [Docker Docs: Docker run reference](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/).

Instead of using the latest pre-built Docker image, you can also specify a Docker image tag (which corresponds to the tags [released on GitHub](https://github.com/localheinz/composer-normalize-action/releases)):

```yaml
name: CI

on: push

jobs:
  composer-normalize:
    name: composer-normalize
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: composer-normalize-action
        uses: docker://localheinz/composer-normalize-action:0.4.2
```

### Environment Variables

If you wish to specify the version of [`localheinz/composer-normalize`](https://github.com/localheinz/composer-normalize)  that should be used by the action, you can use the `COMPOSER_NORMALIZE_VERSION` environment variable:

```yaml
name: CI

on: push

jobs:
  composer-normalize:
    name: composer-normalize
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: composer-normalize-action
        uses: docker://localheinz/composer-normalize-action:0.4.2
        env:
          COMPOSER_NORMALIZE_VERSION: '^1.3.0'
```

This value will be passed to [`entrypoint.sh`](entrypoint.sh) where it will be used for running

```
$ composer global require localheinz/composer-normalize:$COMPOSER_NORMALIZE_VERSION
```

It can be any value that is understood by [`composer`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md).
